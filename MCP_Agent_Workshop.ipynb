    "## Building Agentic Workflows with the Model Context Protocol (MCP)\n",

    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to build a modular, enterprise-grade email assistant using the **Oracle Model Context Protocol (MCP)** as the backbone for all agent-tool orchestration. MCP empowers you to decouple business logic into reusable \"tools\" that are securely registered and dynamically accessed by GenAI agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "**With MCP, your agents can:**\n",
    "- Search and summarize organization-specific documents through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\n",
    "- Look up email recipients from authoritative company directories\n",
    "- Draft, send, and manage emails—all via orchestrated tool calls rather than hardcoded logic\n",
    "\n",
    "**In this workshop, you'll learn how to:**\n",
    "1. Set up a robust, MCP-based environment for scalable agent workflows using Oracle, LangChain, and MCP\n",
    "2. Register custom business and document tools using the MCP Tool Server (`@mcp.tool`)\n",
    "3. Connect notebooks and applications to the MCP Tool Server, enabling dynamic discovery and invocation of registered tools\n",
    "4. Perform advanced document ingestion, semantic search, and retrieval using RAG—all as MCP tools\n",
    "5. Orchestrate complex, multi-step tasks via MCP by combining GenAI agent planning with enterprise automation tools\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this notebook, every agent action is backed by the Model Context Protocol (MCP), ensuring modularity, transparency, and ease of extension as your enterprise needs evolve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started with MCP!"

    "## 2. Start the MCP Tool Server in the Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Before your GenAI agent can access any tools, you must start the **MCP Tool Server**, which acts as a registry and secure communication bridge between your modular tools and any client (notebooks, apps, or agents). With MCP, you can update, restart, or extend your tool ecosystem independently of your agent logic. This ensures that as team or enterprise needs change, your agents always have access to the latest, most reliable automation tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "The MCP Tool Server is responsible for:\n",
    "- Registering all your custom tools (with `@mcp.tool()` decorators)\n",
    "- Handling communication between your notebook’s agent and the available tools\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "- Start the tool server as a separate background process.\n",
    "- The server listens for requests—such as RAG searches, recipient lookups, or email drafts—from your agent running in the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach ensures modularity: you can update your tools or restart the server independently of your notebook session.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In this notebook, we will:**\n",
    "- Use Python’s `subprocess` module to launch `server.py` in the background.\n",
    "- Display the server code here for transparency and reproducibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tip:** If you modify your tools in `server.py`, restart the server process to load the changes."
